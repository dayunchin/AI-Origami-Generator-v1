AI Origami Generator v1

This is my first AI Origami Generator v1, created with HTML on 31 August 2025.

How I Use AI Origami Generator v1

Close my eyes and recall my past experience of being blind. If you don’t have such an experience, imagine what it feels like to be blind.

Visualize an origami image in my mind and draft a prompt based on that mental image.

Use shortcut keys to enter the prompt.

Use shortcut keys to generate the origami image.

Use AI Feedback, AI Music, or AI Story to evaluate the generated image. Draw inspiration from the text or music code to refine the prompt, then repeat Step 2.

When satisfied with the evaluation, open my eyes and view the result.

Future Improvements

I hope to enhance this app so it can generate origami images in SVG format, allowing blind users to print their creations using a 3D printer.
